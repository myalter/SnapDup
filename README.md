# SnapDup
A snapraid duplicate file utility to help remove duplicate files identified by snapraid.

SnapDup is designed to read the log file generated by command: 'snapraid dup -l dup.txt'
And onnce the dup log file is read the user can select between the two duplicate duplicate files for deletion. 
SnapDup will prevent both dupliate files from being checked. After all the files are checked for delete, click 
"Generate Script" to create either Windows or Linix command script. This script can be copied to a text editor and saved
as a shell script for execution.
